## Examples

Below are some examples of what you can currently use the gem for with the Pexels API. If anything is missing or broken please create a Bg report or pull request with a fix.

### Get a photo with id

If you know the ID of the Pexels photo, you can fetch it directly
```ruby
photo = Pexels::Photo.get(PHOTO_ID)
```

### Search photos

The search method accepts three arguments: (query, per_page, page). Variables `per_page` (max: 80) and `page` (max: 1000) are optional and default at 15 & 1 respectively.
```ruby
search_results = Pexels::Photo.search('The Ocean')
```

### Fetch curated collection

Fetch the most recent curated collection of photos. It **does not** accept `query`, but it also **does** accept `per_page` and `page`
```ruby
search_results = Pexels::Photo.curated
```

### Fetch random curated photo

Fetch a random photo from the curated collection.
```ruby
photo = Pexels::Photo.random
```
